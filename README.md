# OSSU Computer Science Journey
 This repository tracks my personal progress through the [`OPEN SOURCE SOCIETY UNIVERSITY (OSSU)` in Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

## Goal
Build a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals, software development, and real-world applications through self-paced study and hands-on practice.

## Status
This is a personal learning and projects that is still evolving, Feedback is welcome
